# This is a backend petproject for an imaginary library. 
## I made this for practice Spring Boot and Hibernate. I used PostgreSQL for the database, if you want to use it too please add these environmental variables to your IDE: POSTGRES_DB_NAME, POSTGRES_USERNAME, POSTGRES_PASSWORD. Feel free to use another database sytem, just replace application.properties.
## I recommend to use Postman or any other API platform to check my API endpoints.
## Future plans: add Spring Security and make the server side as robust as possible.
### Hint: use UUID-s for id
